# 4 Computed Properties + Watchers

## Computed Properties

We sometimes have data, but want to massage it into some viewable form. Templating logic should be **very simple**, so all the required "massaging" should be done in a computed property. Here is an example:

```html
<div id="example">
  <p>Original message: "{{ message }}"</p>
  <p>Computed reversed message: "{{ reversedMessage }}"</p>
</div>
```

```javascript
var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#example',
  data: {
    message: 'Hello'
  },
  computed: {
    // a computed getter
    reversedMessage: function () {
      // `this` points to the vm instance
      return this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
})
```

Computed properties are **cached**, and are only computed again when their underlying data binding changes. This means that something like this will **not** be recomputed:

```javascript
computed: {
  now: function () {
    return Date.now()
  }
}
```

For the desired behavior, we should extract `now` as a function, not as a `computed` property. 

We can also define separate `get` and `set` operators on computed properties, like so:

```javascript
computed: {
  fullName: {
    // getter
    get: function () {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    },
    // setter
    set: function (newValue) {
      var names = newValue.split(' ')
      this.firstName = names[0]
      this.lastName = names[names.length - 1]
    }
  }
}
```

## Watched Properties

We can also use a more generic `watch` property, which is **also recomputed** when the underlying data instance changes. For example

```javascript
var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#demo',
  data: {
    firstName: 'Foo',
    lastName: 'Bar',
    fullName: 'Foo Bar'
  },
  watch: {
    firstName: function (val) {
      this.fullName = val + ' ' + this.lastName
    },
    lastName: function (val) {
      this.fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + val
    }
  }
})
```

Notice that the watched property is **not meant to be accessible**. Instead, it defines the properties **to watch**, and does some massaging of `fullName`, which is already defined in the data object. There is an alternative way, through the [vm.$watch](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-watch) API.

So - why even use watched properties? These are important when we want to perform async and/or expensive operations. Take this example:

```html
<div id="watch-example">
  <p>
    Ask a yes/no question:
    <input v-model="question">
  </p>
  <p>{{ answer }}</p>
</div>
```

We have an input with a two-way binding to `question`, and an interpolated `answer`.

```html
<!-- Since there is already a rich ecosystem of ajax libraries    -->
<!-- and collections of general-purpose utility methods, Vue core -->
<!-- is able to remain small by not reinventing them. This also   -->
<!-- gives you the freedom to use what you're familiar with.      -->

<script>
var watchExampleVM = new Vue({
  el: '#watch-example',
  data: {
    question: '',
    answer: 'I cannot give you an answer until you ask a question!'
  },
  watch: {
    // whenever question changes, this function will run
    question: function (newQuestion, oldQuestion) {
      this.answer = 'Waiting for you to stop typing...'
      this.debouncedGetAnswer()
    }
  },
  created: function () {
    // _.debounce is a function provided by lodash to limit how
    // often a particularly expensive operation can be run.
    // In this case, we want to limit how often we access
    // yesno.wtf/api, waiting until the user has completely
    // finished typing before making the ajax request. To learn
    // more about the _.debounce function (and its cousin
    // _.throttle), visit: https://lodash.com/docs#debounce
    this.debouncedGetAnswer = _.debounce(this.getAnswer, 500)
  },
  methods: {
    getAnswer: function () {
      if (this.question.indexOf('?') === -1) {
        this.answer = 'Questions usually contain a question mark. ;-)'
        return
      }
      this.answer = 'Thinking...'
      var vm = this
      axios.get('https://yesno.wtf/api')
        .then(function (response) {
          vm.answer = _.capitalize(response.data.answer)
        })
        .catch(function (error) {
          vm.answer = 'Error! Could not reach the API. ' + error
        })
    }
  }
})
</script>
```

The above example is pretty straightforward, and isn't replaceable by a computed property.
